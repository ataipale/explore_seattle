# explore_seattle


D3 / Bootstrap Flask app. Interactive visualization of yelp data on Seattle restaurants, including [a spark-based lexrank summarizer](https://github.com/karlhigley/lexrank-summarizer). [See the visualization](http://www.expl0re.website)

Using the Yelp API and [a python web scraper](https://github.com/ataipale/yelp_but_better) I gathered restaurant reviews and information on every yelp-reviewed restaurant in Seattle. The review summaries, restaurant categorization, and rating are visualized on a map of Seattle. 

##Future Work
-Add a predictive text search box to search restaurant names and categories. <br>
-Make the dropdown menu multiselection capable. <br>
-Overlay this data with other sources of public data like income levels, tax information... to allow users to explore the connection between yelp and government data sources. <br>
-add zooming <br>
